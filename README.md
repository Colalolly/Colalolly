### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:exclamation: Something important to visitors

For throwing away my old incomprehensible username and starting a whole new era in my career as developer, I **change my username** in Feb 2023, 

and therefore unfortunately **lost ALL my commits before February 2023** by the side effect which github items said.

I hope this action DON'T influence your impression about me.

THIS STATEMENT WILL BE DISCARDED IN 2025.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- Java

:racehorse: I'm on the path of new life.
